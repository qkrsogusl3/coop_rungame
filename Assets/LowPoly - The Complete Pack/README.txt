Hello! And thanks for purchasing this Asset.

This Asset requires some Standard Assets to work properly:
	-Characters
	-Effects
	-Environments

If you import them into the project, everything should work fine.

In addition, for the Camera Effects to work fine, you have to set up the Deferred rendering path in the Player Settings.

I hope you enjoy this asset!

Regards, 3Dynamite.
